## **Why this Project?**

Every developer should know some basic technologies and libraries which he often has 
to use and implement in his regular work process during app development. 
That is why I decided to create the app _Popular Movies Guide_ which
covers some of these basic technologies, and I'll improve it more while I'll get my 
personal growth as the Android programmer
